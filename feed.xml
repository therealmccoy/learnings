<p>What you learn; is a useful information, knowledge or skill.</p>
<p>During the course of my day to day activities, I encounter some stuff, which is a new learning. This site details all these stuff.</p>
<p>A couple of reasons for doing that:</p>
<p class="align-left">a.) That I have a list and could gauge my progress b.) I could reference the list and revise my knowledge on the subject c.) I could reference the list and then update my knowledge on those subjects.</p>
<p>Please be rest assured that this would cover a wide range of topics and subjects and may vary from season to season, depending upon what I am doing.</p>
<p>A couple of months back, it could have been a lot about fishing, when I was apprenticing.</p>
<p>I wish I could give you a list of topics, but you could find out from the tags itself.</p>
<p>Please feel free to comment and reach out to me, if you have any query or comments.</p>
