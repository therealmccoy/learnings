This site details all these stuff.</p>\n<p>A couple of reasons for doing that:</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\">a.) That I have a list and could gauge my progress b.) I could reference the list and revise my knowledge on the subject c.) I could reference the list and then update my knowledge on those subjects.</p>\n<p>Please be rest assured that this would cover a wide range of topics and subjects and may vary from season to season, depending upon what I am doing.</p>\n<p>A couple of months back, it could have been a lot about fishing, when I was apprenticing.</p>\n<p>I wish I could give you a list of topics, but you could find out from the tags itself.</p>\n<p>Please feel free to comment and reach out to me, if you have any query or comments.</p>\n<p>Â </p>",
